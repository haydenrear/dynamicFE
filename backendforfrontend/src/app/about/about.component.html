<h1>Dynamic Parser</h1>
<h2>What is the dynamic parser?</h2>
<p>Java is known to be a language with lots of boilerplate. In JavaScript, when you retrieve data in JSON it is possible to access the data dynamically by using the direct member access operator (the dot) to access a property. In java, it is necessary to serialize the object into a POJO, and that means creating an object, usually not dynamically. Unfortunately, in many cases it takes much work and effort to create the domain object and the developer needs to write that code beforehand. The dynamic parser provides a way to have that work done for you. Enter the JSON, and it will provide the classes.</p>
